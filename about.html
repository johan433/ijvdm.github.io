                        <h3>Background & Education</h3>
                        <p>My academic journey began with a deep fascination for the fundamental questions of physics and consciousness. With advanced degrees in theoretical physics and extensive research experience, I've dedicated my career to understanding the deepest principles governing our universe.</p>
                        <p>My interdisciplinary approach combines rigorous mathematical frameworks with philosophical inquiry, bridging the gap between hard sciences and consciousness studies.</p>

                        <h3>Research Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>I believe that the most profound discoveries emerge at the intersection of disciplines. My work seeks to unify quantum mechanics, general relativity, information theory, and consciousness studies into a coherent framework.</p>
                        <p>Rather than viewing these as separate domains, I explore how they might represent different aspects of a single, underlying reality â€“ a perspective that drives my pursuit of a Theory of Everything.</p>

                        <h3>Current Focus</h3>
                        <p>My current research centers on developing mathematical models that describe consciousness as a fundamental feature of the universe, similar to mass or charge. This work has implications for quantum mechanics, information processing, and our understanding of reality itself.</p>
                        <p>I'm particularly interested in how information geometry might provide the mathematical foundation for a unified theory that encompasses both physical and conscious phenomena.</p>

                        <h3>Vision & Goals</h3>
                        <p>My ultimate goal is to contribute to humanity's understanding of reality through rigorous scientific investigation. I envision a future where the artificial boundaries between physics, consciousness, and information theory dissolve into a unified understanding.</p>
                        <p>Through my research, publications, and theoretical work, I aim to advance our collective knowledge and inspire the next generation of scientists and thinkers.</p>
